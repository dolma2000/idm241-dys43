        <h3>Trigger</h3>
        <p>Hovering above the blob and then clicking on it.</p>
    
        <h3>Rules</h3>
        <p>When you hover, the Blob will increase in size and change to a vibrant gradient color. The text inside will also increase in size and change from black to white. Before the Blob is clicked on, the content that will appear once clicked is hidden and will load automatically when the user enters the webpage. Once the Blob is clicked on, the Blob will increase to fill up the whole screen and the word inside it will dissappear. Once the screen is filled then the content hidden will show up.</p>
    
        <h3>Feedback</h3>
        <p>For hover, user will see both the Blob and text get bigger, and have the color change too. When you tap on the Blob, it will fill up the whole screen with its gradient color. Then the word "Photos" and the 3 images will appear.</p>
    
        <h3>Loops & Modes</h3>
        <p>There is a loop - the Blob will be constantly changing its shape slightly. The mode is the new page that appear when the Blob fills up the screen.</p>
