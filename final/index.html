        <p><b>Reference from: <a class="link" target="blank" href="http://www.uimotionkit.io/">UI Motion Kit</a></b> <br>
            The Blob I will be improving from is seen at the starting screen from the UI Motion Kit website. Currently, the blob itself is not interactive and eventually proceeds to a new page.

        <p>  
           <b>How I want to Improve:</b> <br><br> First I want it to be interactive. Once you hover over it, I want to make it so that the blob and text increase in size and the color of the blob will change too. <br><br>Below is a demo of how I want it to roughly look like. I wasn't able to find exactly what I wanted so I animated it in After Affect instead.

            <h3>Trigger</h3>
            <p>Hovering above the Blob.</p>

            <h3>Rules</h3>
            <p>The Blob will increase in size and change to a vibrant gradient color. The text inside will also increase in size and change from black to white.</p>

            <h3>Feedback</h3>
            <p>Same as the rules, user will see the Blob and text get bigger, and have the color change too.</p>
        
            <h3>Loops & Modes</h3>
            <p>There is a loop - the blob will be constantly changing its shape slightly. There are no modes. </p>
