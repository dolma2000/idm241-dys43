        <p><b>Reference from: <a class="link" target="blank" href="http://www.dolmayangchensherpa.com/idm241/beta/build.html/">Blob</a></b> <br>
            The Blob I will be improving is from my Beta Build. Currently the only form of interaction is by hovering on top and it only just increases in size and changes color.

        <p>  
           <b>How I want to Improve:</b> <br><br> What I want to add ontop of my beta build is the click trigger. Once clicked, the blob will fill up the whole screen into a new page where the content inside will appear.

            <h3>Trigger</h3>
            <p>Clicking on the blob.</p>

            <h3>Rules</h3>
            <p>Before the blob is clicked on, the content that will appear once clicked is set to "display:none" and will load automatically when the user enter the webpage. Once the blob is clicked on, the blob will increase to fill up the whole screen and the word inside it will dissappear. Once the screen is filled then the content hidden will show up. </p>

            <h3>Feedback</h3>
            <p>When you tap on the blob, it will decrease in size a bit, as if it is being pushed, and then it will fill up the whole screen with its gradient color. Then the word "Photos" and the images will appear.</p>
        
            <h3>Loops & Modes</h3>
            <p>There is no loop. The mode is the new page that appear when the blob fills up the screen.</p>
