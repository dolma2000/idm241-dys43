            Objective of Project: <br>
            To identiify micro interaction and design an improved and meaningful digital experience based on a holistic consideration of users experience.
            In this course, I will identify and improve three micro interactions in three different stages: Alpha(Simple), Beta(Slightly difficult), and Final(Complex). <br>
            Alpha (Simple): Hamburger Menu Bar <br>
            URL of original interface: <a target="blank" href="www.dolmayangchensherpa.com">My Portfolio Website</a> <br>
            Currently, the Hamburger Menu Bar is just a static button that when pressed upon, the menu will slide in form the left covering over half of the page's width.
            How I want to Improve: First, I want the Hamburger Icon to transitiion to an "X" Icon through animation. Second, I want the other links in the menu bar to slide in one by one like a ripple as shown below.
        </p>

        <p>
            Trigger: Tapping on the Hamburger Icon. <br>
            Rules: After tapping on the Hamburger Icon, it reveals the Menu Bar. <br>
            Feedback: The Hamburger Icon will transition into an X and the whole menu bar will appear sliding from the left, with the links coming in one by one. <br>
            Loops & Modes: The mode here is the Menu Bar appearing with extra information, which are the 3 links.
